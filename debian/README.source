The source tar ball was repackaged since it contained pre-compiled binary
libraries for Windows:

 abc/lib/x64/pthreadVC2.dll | Bin 82944 -> 0 bytes
 abc/lib/x64/pthreadVC2.lib | Bin 29738 -> 0 bytes
 abc/lib/x86/pthreadVC2.dll | Bin 86070 -> 0 bytes
 abc/lib/x86/pthreadVC2.lib | Bin 29280 -> 0 bytes

These are the only files that have been removed in the +dfsg tar ball.
