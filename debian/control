Description: ABC - A System for Sequential Synthesis and Verification 
 This is a growing software system for synthesis and verification of binary
 sequential logic circuits appearing in synchronous hardware designs. ABC
 combines scalable logic optimization based on And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs),
 optimal-delay DAG-based technology mapping for look-up tables and standard
 cells, and innovative algorithms for sequential synthesis and verification.
 .
 ABC provides an experimental implementation of these algorithms and a
 programming environment for building similar applications. Future development
 will focus on improving the algorithms and making most of the packages
 stand-alone. This will allow the user to customize ABC for their needs as if
 it were a tool-box rather than a complete tool.
